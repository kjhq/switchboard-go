<h1 align="center">Switchboard Go</h1>

Switchboard Go is a small Go reverse proxy for the OpenCode Go API. It exposes
an OpenAI-compatible local endpoint, protects it with your own API key, and
cycles through multiple upstream OpenCode Go API keys when one is exhausted.

It is designed to run on a trusted server in your local network so OpenAI-
compatible tools can use one stable `base_url` while Switchboard Go handles
upstream key failover.

## Features

- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/*` reverse proxy
- Works with common OpenAI-compatible clients and tools via `base_url`
- Local proxy authentication with `Authorization: Bearer <PROXY_API_KEY>`
- Upstream OpenCode Go key rotation from YAML config or env vars
- Automatic failover on quota/usage-exhausted `429` responses
- Cyclic key selection: after the last key, rotation loops back to the first
- Inferred key status endpoint at `/admin/status`
- Active validation endpoint at `/admin/validate-keys`
- Unauthenticated readiness endpoint at `/readyz`
- SMTP notifications when a key is exhausted and when all keys are exhausted
- YAML config file support with environment-variable overrides
- Configurable max request body size
- Streaming-friendly proxying: no full-response timeout on upstream responses
- Dockerfile included
- Small Go binary deployment

## How it works

Clients call this proxy as if it were an OpenAI-compatible API:

```text
OpenAI-compatible tool -> Switchboard Go -> https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1
```

Incoming `/v1` paths are stripped before forwarding to the configured upstream
base URL:

```text
GET  /v1/models           -> GET  https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models
POST /v1/chat/completions -> POST https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions
```

When an upstream key returns a quota/usage-exhausted `429`, Switchboard Go marks
that key as exhausted, sends a best-effort SMTP notification, and retries the
same request with the next non-exhausted key. If every key is exhausted, it
returns an OpenAI-style `429` JSON error.

Authentication failures on `/v1/*` and `/admin/*` return an OpenAI-style JSON
error envelope with HTTP 401.

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or newer for source builds
- One or more OpenCode Go API keys
- Optional SMTP server for notifications
- Optional Docker for container deployment

## Configuration

Switchboard Go supports both YAML config files and environment variables.

Configuration precedence, from lowest to highest:

1. Built-in defaults
2. YAML config file
3. Environment variables

This lets you keep normal server settings in a config file while injecting
secrets through environment variables, systemd environment files, Docker secrets,
or your deployment platform.

### Config file discovery

Switchboard Go looks for a config file in this order:

1. `SWITCHBOARD_GO_CONFIG`, if set
2. `~/.config/switchboard-go/config.yaml`, if it exists
3. `/etc/switchboard-go/config.yaml`, if it exists
4. No config file

If `SWITCHBOARD_GO_CONFIG` is set, the file must exist and be valid YAML. Missing
or invalid explicit config files are startup errors.

### YAML example

```yaml
server:
  listen_addr: "127.0.0.1:8080"
  proxy_api_key: "replace-with-a-long-random-local-key"

upstream:
  base_url: "https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1"
  api_keys:
    - "sk-first"
    - "sk-second"
    - "sk-third"

smtp:
  host: "smtp.example.com"
  port: 587
  username: "alerts@example.com"
  password: "your-smtp-password"
  from: "alerts@example.com"
  to: "you@example.com"
  tls: false
  starttls: true

limits:
  max_request_body_bytes: 20971520
```

Recommended user config path: `~/.config/switchboard-go/config.yaml`.

Recommended system config path: `/etc/switchboard-go/config.yaml`.

Use restrictive permissions, such as `0600`, for config files containing
secrets.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SWITCHBOARD_GO_CONFIG` | No | | Explicit YAML config path. |
| `PROXY_API_KEY` | Yes\* | | API key clients must use to access this proxy. |
| `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEYS` | Yes\* | | Comma-separated OpenCode Go API keys. |

all set.

## Quick start

With environment variables only:

```bash
export PROXY_API_KEY="replace-with-a-long-random-local-key"
export OPENCODE_GO_API_KEYS="sk-first,sk-second,sk-third"
export LISTEN_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8080"

switchboard-go
```

With a YAML config file:

```bash
export SWITCHBOARD_GO_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/switchboard-go/config.yaml"
switchboard-go
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY"
```

## OpenAI-compatible client setup

Point your client at Switchboard Go and use the proxy API key, not your upstream
OpenCode Go key.

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="$PROXY_API_KEY"
```

Example chat completion:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "minimax-m3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

Streaming requests are proxied as normal HTTP streams:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "minimax-m3",
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem"}]
  }'
```

## Admin status

`/admin/status` returns inferred key state and the active key index.

`unknown` means the key is configured but has not yet been validated or used
since startup.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "current_key_index": 1,
  "keys": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "state": "exhausted",
      "last_429_time": "2026-06-19T11:48:29Z",
      "current": false
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "state": "available",
      "current": true
    }
  ],
  "note": "Remaining usage is unavailable from opencode-go API."
}
```

Key states are inferred by this proxy:

- `unknown`: key has not yet been proven available or exhausted
- `available`: key is currently selected and not marked exhausted
- `exhausted`: key returned a quota/usage-exhausted `429`

### Validate keys

`POST /admin/validate-keys` actively checks every configured upstream key against
`/models`, updates in-memory key state, and returns per-key validation results.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/validate-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY"
```

## Usage and quota visibility

OpenCode Go currently does not appear to expose a public API endpoint for
remaining quota or usage by API key. Switchboard Go therefore cannot show exact
remaining usage. It tracks inferred state based on upstream responses and
reports that through `/admin/status`.

If a public usage/quota endpoint becomes available, it can be added without
changing the client-facing OpenAI-compatible API.

## Readiness

`/readyz` is unauthenticated. It returns JSON, verifies required config is loaded,
and checks the currently selected non-exhausted upstream key by calling
`/models` with a 5 second timeout.

## SMTP notifications

Set SMTP variables or YAML fields to receive email when the proxy switches away
from an exhausted key and when all keys have been exhausted.

Example with STARTTLS:

```bash
export SMTP_HOST="smtp.example.com"
export SMTP_PORT="587"
export SMTP_USERNAME="alerts@example.com"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="your-smtp-password"
export SMTP_FROM="alerts@example.com"
export SMTP_TO="you@example.com"
export SMTP_STARTTLS="true"
```

SMTP sending is asynchronous and best effort. Notification failures are logged
but do not fail client requests.

## Docker

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t switchboard-go .
```

Run with environment variables:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080 \
  -e PROXY_API_KEY="replace-with-a-long-random-local-key" \
  -e OPENCODE_GO_API_KEYS="sk-first,sk-second,sk-third" \
  switchboard-go
```

Run with a mounted YAML config:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SWITCHBOARD_GO_CONFIG=/config/config.yaml \
  -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro" \
  switchboard-go
```

Run with non-secret settings in YAML and secrets from env overrides:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SWITCHBOARD_GO_CONFIG=/config/config.yaml \
  -e PROXY_API_KEY="replace-with-a-long-random-local-key" \
  -e OPENCODE_GO_API_KEYS="sk-first,sk-second,sk-third" \
  -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro" \
  switchboard-go
```

The Docker image uses a multi-stage Go build and a distroless non-root runtime
image.

### GHCR

The repo includes a workflow that publishes images to GHCR:

```text
ghcr.io/arsalandotme/switchboard-go
```

## Deployment

### systemd example

Create `/etc/systemd/system/switchboard-go.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Switchboard Go OpenAI-compatible OpenCode Go key-cycling proxy
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Environment=SWITCHBOARD_GO_CONFIG=/etc/switchboard-go/config.yaml
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/switchboard-go/switchboard.env
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/switchboard-go
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
NoNewPrivileges=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## validate-config

Run a config-only check without starting the server:

```bash
switchboard-go validate-config
```

It loads config using normal precedence, validates required values, and prints a
safe summary.

Example `/etc/switchboard-go/switchboard.env`:

```bash
PROXY_API_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-local-key
OPENCODE_GO_API_KEYS=sk-first,sk-second,sk-third
SMTP_PASSWORD=replace-me
```

Use restrictive permissions for config and env files containing secrets.

## Security notes

- Treat both `PROXY_API_KEY` and `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEYS` as secrets.
- Use a long, random `PROXY_API_KEY`.
- Prefer environment variables or secret managers for credentials.
- If secrets are stored in YAML, set file permissions to `0600`.
- Bind to `127.0.0.1` unless other machines on your LAN need access.
- If exposing beyond a trusted LAN, put the service behind TLS and a firewall.
- Do not commit API keys, SMTP credentials, or systemd files containing secrets.
- `/healthz` is intentionally unauthenticated for health checks.
- `/v1/*` and `/admin/*` require authentication.

## Operational behavior

- Startup logs include listen address, upstream base URL, upstream key count,
  SMTP configured yes/no, config source path, and max request body bytes.
- Request bodies larger than `max_request_body_bytes` are rejected with HTTP
  `413`.
- Hop-by-hop and proxy headers are stripped when forwarding.
- The proxy sets a compatible default upstream `User-Agent` if the client does
  not provide one. This avoids upstream blocks of generic HTTP clients.
- If an upstream stream begins successfully and then later emits an error, the
  proxy does not recover mid-stream; it only retries before a response is sent.
- Exhausted keys remain exhausted until the process restarts.
